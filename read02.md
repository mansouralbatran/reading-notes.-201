### What CSS does
The key to understanding how CSS works is to
imagine that there is an invisible box around
every HTML element.
Understanding CSS:
Thinking Insi de the Box
On this page, you can see a basic
HTML page.
On the right hand page, you can
see the same HTML page, but I
have added outlines to each of
the elements so that you can see
how CSS will treat each element
as if it lives inside its own box.

###  How CSS works

### Rules, properties, and values


# PLACING THE SCRIPT
You may see JavaScript in the HTML between
opening <script> and closing </script> tags
(but it is better to put scripts in their own files).
# JAVASCRIPT RUNS WHERE IT IS FOUND IN THE HTML
 ##  DATA TYPES
 * NUMERIC DATA TYPE
 * STRING DATA TYPE
 * BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
 
 ## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
 1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.
2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.
