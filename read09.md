# Forms

## Form Structure
* < fieldset>(You can group related form 
controls together inside the 
< fieldset> element. This is 
particularly helpful for longer 
forms.
Most browsers will show the 
fieldset with a line around 
the edge to show how they are 
related. The appearance of these 
lines can be adjusted using CSS)
* < legend>  (The < legend> element can 
come directly after the opening 
< fieldset> tag and contains a 
caption which helps identify the 
purpose of that group of form 
controls)
* < input>( 1__type  2__name 3__ id )
